      <h2 class="text-heading-blue featurette-heading-smaller">History</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-font">
        Blueprint was founded in late 2012 by Berkeley students who saw a fit
        between the talent of university students and the need of the community
        around them. Spring 2013 was our first semester operating at Berkeley,
        and our three projects were a great success. We look forward to continuing
        our growth and improvement each and every semester.

      <h2 class="text-heading-blue featurette-heading-smaller">What We Do</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-font">
        Blueprint is a non-profit organization aimed at bringing
        technologies to local nonprofit organizations that are making social
        change. We want to aid and be part of the group of community builders
        who are doing meaningful productive work.
        Each semester, teams of five students work with non-profit organizations to
        implement technologies for efficiency and accessibility. We work on web and mobile
        applications for our clients to help them address and solve some of their
        systemic problems.
